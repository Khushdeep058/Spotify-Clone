# Spotify-Clone
🎧 Spotify Clone (HTML & CSS Only)
This is a non-functioning visual clone of Spotify's web player, built using HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate the layout and design of key sections of the original Spotify interface. It is intended purely for front-end practice and educational purposes.

🚀 Technologies Used
HTML – for structuring the web pages

CSS – for styling, layout, and responsive design

🖋️ Fonts & Icons
Since Spotify uses proprietary assets, suitable alternatives were implemented:

Fonts – Google Fonts was used to match Spotify's aesthetic as closely as possible.

Icons – Font Awesome free icon set was used. Some sections also utilize custom images to resemble original Spotify icons.

🎨 Features
🎵 Sidebar navigation similar to Spotify's layout

📚 Library section with customizable options

📱 Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

💽 Styled music cards for showcasing content

➖ Footer section with a decorative horizontal line

📌 Note
This project is not functional and does not include any music playback or interactive backend functionality. It is strictly a front-end UI clone for learning and design reference.
